1.0001^(tick/2)

1） ratio

What is ratio?
ratio is the accumulated product of magic factors that represents the intermediate calculation of 1.0001^(abs_tick/2).


What Are Magic Factors?
Magic factors are pre-calculated constants that represent specific mathematical values:
// Each magic factor = 2^64 / (1.0001^(2^(i-1)))
Magic factor 0 = 2^64 / 1.0001^1    = 2^64 / 1.0001
Magic factor 1 = 2^64 / 1.0001^2    = 2^64 / 1.0001^2  
Magic factor 2 = 2^64 / 1.0001^4    = 2^64 / 1.0001^4
Magic factor 3 = 2^64 / 1.0001^8    = 2^64 / 1.0001^8
Magic factor 4 = 2^64 / 1.0001^16   = 2^64 / 1.0001^16
// ... and so on


2) Why This Complex Approach?
1. Performance - Avoid Expensive Operations
Traditional approach would be:
// This would be extremely slow and imprecise
let result = 1.0001_f64.powf(tick as f64 / 2.0);

Problems with traditional approach:
    Floating-point arithmetic is slow on blockchain
    Precision loss for large numbers
    Non-deterministic results across different platforms
    High gas costs for complex math operations


2. Bit Manipulation is Fast
This approach uses:
// Bit operations are extremely fast
if abs_tick & 0x1 != 0 {  // Check if bit is set
    ratio = (ratio * magic_factor) >> NUM_64  // Fast multiply and shift
}
Benefits:
    Bit operations are CPU-native and fast
    No floating-point calculations
    Deterministic results
    Low gas costs

3. The Mathematical Insight:
3.1. Power of 2 Decomposition
Any integer can be written as a sum of powers of 2:
tick = 5 = 1 + 4 = 2^0 + 2^2
tick = 13 = 1 + 4 + 8 = 2^0 + 2^2 + 2^3

3.2. Exponential Property
1.0001^(a + b) = 1.0001^a * 1.0001^b
1.0001^5 = 1.0001^(1 + 4) = 1.0001^1 * 1.0001^4


3.3 Why This Design Pattern?
1. Lookup Table Approach
Instead of calculating 1.0001^x at runtime, we:
Pre-calculate all possible values for powers of 2
Store them as magic factors
Look up and multiply only the ones we need

3.4 举例
Binary Number System Advantage
tick = 5 = 0b101
We only need magic factors for bits 0 and 2:
- Bit 0: 1.0001^1
- Bit 2: 1.0001^4
Result: 1.0001^1 * 1.0001^4 = 1.0001^5

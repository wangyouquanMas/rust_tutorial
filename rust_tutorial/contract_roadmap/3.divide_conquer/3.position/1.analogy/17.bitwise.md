1. bitwise定义
Bitwise operations are operations that directly manipulate the individual bits (0s and 1s) of an integer. Instead of working with the entire number at once, bitwise operations work on each bit individually.

示例：

Common Bitwise Operators
AND (&):Compares each bit of two numbers and returns a 1 if both bits are 1; otherwise, it returns 0.
OR (|):Compares each bit of two numbers and returns a 1 if at least one of the bits is 1; otherwise, it returns 0.

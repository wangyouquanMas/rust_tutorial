1. 定义
Leading zeros refer to the number of zeros at the beginning of a binary number, before the first 1 appears. For example:

The binary number 00000010 has 6 leading zeros.

The binary number 1001101 has 0 leading zeros because the first 1 is right at the start.

2. 应用
how leading zeros help represent the integer part of the logarithm

The formula log2(n) ≈ 127 - leading_zeros(n) comes from understanding the relationship between the position of the highest set bit (i.e., the most significant bit, or MSB) in the binary representation of a number and the logarithm.

示例：
let leading_zeros = sqrt_price_x64.leading_zeros();
let msb: u32 = 128 - leading_zeros - 1;
1）leading_zeros counts how many leading zeros are before the first 1 bit in the binary representation of sqrt_price_x64.

2）msb calculates the position of the most significant bit (msb), which directly corresponds to the integer part of log2(sqrt_price_x64).

So, for sqrt_price_x64 = 2 (binary: 10), the msb is 1, which is exactly the integer part of log2(2).

1. 目的
The contract needs to store information about each tick in order to
track the amount of net liquidity that should be added or removed
when the tick is crossed, as well as to track the fees earned above
and below that tick.


2. track哪些值？ 这些值的作用是什么？

2.1 each tick track ΔL
ΔL means the total amount of liquidity that should be kicked in or out when the tick is crossed. 

2.2 具体怎么记ΔL ？
the tick only needs to track one signed integer: the amount of liquidity added(or, if negative, removed)
when the tick is crossed going left to right. 

2.3 该值什么时候更新？ TODO:? 
This value does not need to be updated when the tick is crossed (but only when a position with a bound at that tick is updated)

2.4 当没有任何liquidity referencing that tick时，我们需要uninitialize a tick.
1) 什么是net liquidity ? 
Net liquidity represents the change in liquidity at a specific tick, considering both additions and removals. In other words, net liquidity is the final amount of liquidity that remains after a transaction.
举例：
For example:

If a liquidity provider adds 100 units of liquidity to the pool at a specific tick, that’s an addition.

If a liquidity provider removes 50 units of liquidity from the same tick, that’s a removal.

Net liquidity (ΔL) would be the difference between these two amounts:

Net liquidity
=
100
−
50
=
50
 units of liquidity
Net liquidity=100−50=50 units of liquidity
In this case, the net liquidity is 50, meaning there’s a positive change of 50 units of liquidity.

If the net liquidity (ΔL) is zero, it means that liquidity was removed completely (or the amount added and removed are equal) for that tick.

2） Gross Liquidity 什么意思?
Gross liquidity refers to the total amount of liquidity ever referenced by a tick. It includes both the liquidity that has been added and removed over time.

Gross liquidity is cumulative. Even if a liquidity position is removed, it still tracks the total amount of liquidity that has referenced that tick at any point in time.


example : 
xample:
Let's assume that we have a liquidity pool with two assets: Token1 and Token2, and we are focusing on a specific tick range.

We'll work with one tick (say tick 100), and net liquidity and gross liquidity will track the changes in liquidity over time.

Step-by-Step Scenario:
Step 1: Adding Liquidity at Tick 100

Initial state: No liquidity at tick 100.

A liquidity provider adds 100 Token1 and 10,000 Token2 to the pool at tick 100.

Net liquidity at tick 100 is +100 (since 100 Token1 has been added).

Gross liquidity at tick 100 is +100 (the total amount of liquidity ever added at tick 100).

Step 2: Removing Liquidity at Tick 100

After some time, the liquidity provider decides to remove their liquidity from tick 100. They remove 100 Token1 and 10,000 Token2.

Net liquidity at tick 100 becomes 0 (because they removed all of their liquidity).

Gross liquidity at tick 100 is still +100 because it tracks the total amount of liquidity that has been referenced at this tick, even though the liquidity is no longer present in the pool.

Step 3: Adding More Liquidity at Tick 100

A new liquidity provider adds 200 Token1 and 20,000 Token2 at tick 100.

Net liquidity at tick 100 is now +200 (because 200 Token1 was added).

Gross liquidity at tick 100 is now +300 (because gross liquidity tracks all liquidity ever referenced, and the first liquidity provider added 100 Token1, plus the second liquidity provider added 200 Token1, so total gross liquidity at tick 100 is 100 + 200 = 300).


3) net liquidity and gross liquidity的比较？ 
Key Points:
Net liquidity represents the current state of liquidity at a tick — it reflects the difference between liquidity added and liquidity removed.

Gross liquidity represents the total liquidity ever referenced at that tick — it does not decrease even if liquidity is removed. It is the cumulative sum of liquidity that has been added at that tick.

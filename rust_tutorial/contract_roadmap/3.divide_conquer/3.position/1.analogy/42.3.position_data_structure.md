1. 数据结构
关键字段：
1） liquidity定义
liquidity 表示 the amount of virtual liquidity that the position represented the last time this position was touched. 
Specifically, liquidity could be thought of as sqrt(x*y), where x and y are the respective amounts of virtual
token0 and virtual token1 that this liquidity contributes to the pool at any time that it is within range. 

问题：liquidity是 delta or gross ? 
通过打印日志查看，这是 delta liquidity. 
Calculated amounts:
- Amount 0: 9999999
- Amount 1: 8759
- Liquidity: 2593241

open_position_with_token22_nft_instr liquidity: 2593241 
表示当前的这个position的添加的liquidity.


问题：only virtual token0/1 ? 





2) feeGrowthInside0LastX128 / feeGrowthInside1LastX128作用
This liquidity number 并不 reflect the fee that have been accumulated siince the contract was last touched, which we will call uncollected fees. Computing these uncollected fees requires additional stored values on the position, feeGrowthInside0Last and feeGrowthInside1Last.

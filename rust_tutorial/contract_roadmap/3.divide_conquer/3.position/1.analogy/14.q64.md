1. 定义

Q64.64 is a type of fixed-point arithmetic where numbers are represented as integers, but we treat them as if they had fractional parts, without using floating-point operations. This is particularly useful when working in environments that don't support floating-point numbers, or when you need more precision than floating points provide.


2. 特性
1） 64.64表示什么意思？
Q64.64 means there are 64 bits allocated for the integer part of the number, and 64 bits for the fractional part.

示例：如何表示2.5？ 
So, instead of representing a number like 2.5 with a decimal point, we shift the decimal point (essentially multiplying the number by a constant, 
2^64) to make the entire number an integer.

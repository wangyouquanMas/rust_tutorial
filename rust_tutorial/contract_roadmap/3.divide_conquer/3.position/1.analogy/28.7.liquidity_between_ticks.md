1. liquidity between ticks 

Tick: A tick is a specific price level or interval, and each tick represents a discrete price range where liquidity can be provided or concentrated.

Tick Bound: This refers to the lower and upper bounds of the price range in which a liquidity provider (LP) chooses to provide liquidity. These bounds are represented by specific ticks:

Lower tick bound: The lowest price at which the liquidity provider is willing to provide liquidity.

Upper tick bound: The highest price at which the liquidity provider is willing to provide liquidity.

Example:

If you have a liquidity range between two ticks:

Lower tick bound: Tick at price 100

Upper tick bound: Tick at price 110

Liquidity would only be active in this range, meaning it would provide liquidity for trades occurring between the price range of 100 and 110.

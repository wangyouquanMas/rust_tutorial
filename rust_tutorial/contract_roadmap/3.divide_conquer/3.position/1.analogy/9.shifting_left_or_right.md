Example:
    Let's do a step-by-step example:
    Starting Number: 0001 (which is 1 in decimal).

    First Shift (shift left by 1 bit):

    Original: 0001 (1 in decimal).

    After shifting left by 1: 0010 (which is 2 in decimal).

    Second Shift (shift left by 1 bit):

    Original: 0010 (2 in decimal).

    After shifting left by 1: 0100 (which is 4 in decimal).

    Third Shift (shift left by 1 bit):

    Original: 0100 (4 in decimal).

    After shifting left by 1: 1000 (which is 8 in decimal).


Summary:
    Shifting left is equivalent to multiplying the number by 2 for each shift.

    The number of 1s and 0s in the binary representation increases, and each shift to the left increases the value exponentially.

Exactly 👍 — here’s why:

We start with $y \in [1,2)$.

* The smallest possible $y$ is $1$. Then $y^2 = 1^2 = 1$.
* The largest possible $y$ is just below $2$. Then $y^2 < 4$.

So:

$$
y^2 \in [1,4).
$$

That means after squaring, the result is **always between 1 and 4**.

* If $y^2 < 2$, then it’s in the subrange $[1,2)$.
* If $y^2 \geq 2$, then it’s in the subrange $[2,4)$.

That’s why we say: “if $y^2 \geq 2$, it must be in $[2,4)$.”

👉 And when it falls in $[2,4)$, dividing by 2 (normalization) brings it back into $[1,2)$ so we can keep iterating.

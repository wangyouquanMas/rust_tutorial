1. 理解Flip的作用

- “Flip” means the tick’s initialized status toggled.
  - Before: liquidity_gross == 0 (uninitialized) → After: > 0 (initialized)
  - Or Before: > 0 (initialized) → After: 0 (uninitialized)

- In code it’s computed as XOR: flipped = (liquidity_gross_after == 0) != (liquidity_gross_before == 0). When true:
  - On 0 → >0: set fee/reward outside snapshots and update liquidity_net.
  - On >0 → 0: tick becomes uninitialized; caller can clear it and update counts/bitmap.

liquidity_net: The signed liquidity delta applied to the pool when the price crosses this tick.
At a lower tick, liquidity_net increases by the position’s liquidity (added when crossing left→right).
At an upper tick, liquidity_net decreases by the position’s liquidity (removed when crossing left→right)

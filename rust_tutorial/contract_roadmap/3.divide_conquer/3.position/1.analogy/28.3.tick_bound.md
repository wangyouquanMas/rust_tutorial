1. 理解tick bound的作用

1. 作用
Liquidity only changes at range boundaries. Inside a position’s range, active liquidity is constant; it changes only when price crosses the lower or upper bound.
Accounting is boundary-based. The protocol tracks fee/reward “outside” snapshots and liquidity_net at the two bounds; that’s sufficient to compute in-range growth and pool liquidity. Initializing interior ticks would be redundant.
Efficiency and correctness. Storing only bound ticks minimizes on-chain state and makes “find next initialized tick” meaningful for swaps; initialized ticks represent precisely where liquidity discontinuities occur.
In code:
Only lower/upper ticks are touched and possibly flipped to initialized on add/increase/decrease:
lower: liquidity_net += liquidity_delta
upper: liquidity_net -= liquidity_delta
A tick becomes initialized when its liquidity_gross transitions 0 → >0 during update.

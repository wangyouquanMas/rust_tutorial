Status: Confirmed that tick_array_lower/tick_array_upper are the PDAs backing TickArrayState for the arrays that contain your lower/upper ticks; they’re passed unchecked and then loaded as TickArrayState inside the instruction.
They are PDAs of TickArrayState keyed by ("tick_array", pool_id, start_tick_index).
Lower/upper refer to the arrays that contain the position’s lower/upper ticks; they can be the same PDA if both ticks share the same start index.

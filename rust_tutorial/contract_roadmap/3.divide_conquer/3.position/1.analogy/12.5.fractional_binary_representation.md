### Example 1: $0.101_2$

This is a binary number with the integer part $0$ and the fractional part $101_2$.

To calculate the decimal equivalent:

$$
0.101_2 = 1 \times 2^{-1} + 0 \times 2^{-2} + 1 \times 2^{-3} = 0.5 + 0 + 0.125 = 0.625
$$

So, $0.101_2 = 0.625_{10}$.


2.Converting a Fractional Decimal to Binary

For fractional numbers, you need a slightly different method using repeated multiplication by 2.

Multiply the fractional part by 2.

Write down the integer part (0 or 1) of the result.

Take the fractional part of the result and multiply it by 2 again.

Repeat until the fractional part is 0 or you've reached the desired precision.

The binary number is the integer parts of each multiplication.

Example 2: Convert 0.625 to binary:

0.625 × 2 = 1.25 → integer part = 1

0.25 × 2 = 0.5 → integer part = 0

0.5 × 2 = 1.0 → integer part = 1 (fraction becomes 0)

Reading the integer parts from top to bottom:
0.625 (decimal) = 0.101 (binary).

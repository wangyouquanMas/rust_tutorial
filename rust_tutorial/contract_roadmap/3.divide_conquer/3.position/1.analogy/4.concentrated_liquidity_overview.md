2. A range order 和 limit order的关系 （于LP而言）
2.1 when it's executed ? 
A traditional limit order is an order to buy or sell an asset at a specific price or better.

A range order works similarly but is not executed at a specific price. Instead, it’s executed when the price crosses the chosen range.

2.2 range order是如何工作的？ 
How Does It Work?

When you set a range for your liquidity position (say, from price 100 to 110), your position behaves like a limit order:

When the price crosses into your range, your liquidity is activated, and it starts facilitating trades.

As trades occur, you accumulate fees (since you’re providing liquidity).


2.3 range order的最小间隔
1st Difference: There’s a limit to how narrow a position’s range can be:

In a traditional limit order, you can set the price as precisely as you want. For example, you could set it to buy 1 token for $100.01.

In a range order, you can’t set your range too narrow. There are limits on how small a price range can be. This is to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity in the pool and to prevent excessively high slippage.

Example: You could choose a range like 100–101, but you can't make it like 100.00–100.01 because such a narrow range would not work well in practice. The range must be broad enough to allow for liquidity to be activated.


2.4 当价格crosses the range, 需要主动withdrawn 
2nd Difference: When the price crosses the range, it needs to be withdrawn:
In a traditional limit order, once the price hits your limit, the order is filled, and you receive the assets you wanted to buy/sell.

In a range order, if the price crosses your range, you need to actively withdraw your position (i.e., take the liquidity out) because the position has now been executed. If you don’t withdraw it, and the price moves back across your range (crosses back out), your position will be traded back in the opposite direction, effectively reversing the trade.

Example: If you set a range of 100–110 and the price goes from 105 to 111, your position would have been executed, and you’d have received Token2 for your Token1. If the price then moves back from 111 to 105, the position will be reversed, and you will get your Token1 back (along with the fees earned).

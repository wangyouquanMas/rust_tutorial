Numerical Interpretation in Q64.64 Format
In the Q64.64 fixed-point format used in this code:
The first 64 bits (from the left) represent the integer part
The last 64 bits represent the fractional part
Since this value has:
A "1" at bit position 63 (counting from 0 at the right)
All other bits are "0"
It represents exactly 2^(63-64) = 2^(-1) = 0.5 in decimal.

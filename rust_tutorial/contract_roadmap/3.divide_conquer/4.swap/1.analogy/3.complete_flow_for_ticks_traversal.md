1. 掌握swap traversal multiple ticks logic process 


内容：
1. 过程
Start: Begin swap with current price and liquidity
Find Next Tick: Locate the next initialized tick in the swap direction
Execute Step: Swap until reaching the next tick or exhausting amount
Cross Tick: When price reaches tick boundary:
Update fee growth outside values
Update reward growth outside values
Apply liquidity net change to pool
Move to next tick
Navigate Arrays: If current tick array is exhausted, load next tick array
Repeat: Continue until swap is complete


核心点
Key Mathematical Concepts
Liquidity Net: Each tick stores how much liquidity to add/subtract when crossed
Fee Growth Outside: Tracks fees accumulated outside the tick's range
Directional Logic: zero_for_one determines whether to add or subtract liquidity net
Price Boundaries: Ticks act as discrete price levels where liquidity changes occur
This system ensures that:
Liquidity is properly updated at each tick boundary
Fee calculations remain accurate across multiple tick crossings
The swap can traverse multiple tick arrays efficiently
Price movements are properly bounded by tick spacing


The beauty of this design is that it handles complex multi-tick swaps as a series of simple, atomic steps, each updating the pool state correctly before moving to the next tic

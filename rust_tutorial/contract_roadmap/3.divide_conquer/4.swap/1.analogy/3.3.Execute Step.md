1. 执行过程





1.1. 代码
// Main swap loop - continues until amount is exhausted or price limit is reached
while state.amount_specified_remaining != 0 && state.sqrt_price_x64 != sqrt_price_limit_x64 {
    let mut step = StepComputations::default();
    step.sqrt_price_start_x64 = state.sqrt_price_x64;
    
    // Find the next initialized tick to cross
    let mut next_initialized_tick = tick_array_current
        .next_initialized_tick(state.tick, pool_state.tick_spacing, zero_for_one)?;
    
    // If no more ticks in current array, move to next tick array
    if !next_initialized_tick.is_initialized() {
        let next_initialized_tickarray_index = pool_state
            .next_initialized_tick_array_start_index(
                &tickarray_bitmap_extension,
                current_vaild_tick_array_start_index,
                zero_for_one,
            )?;
        // Load next tick array...
    }
    
    // Set target price for this step
    step.tick_next = next_initialized_tick.tick;
    step.sqrt_price_next_x64 = tick_math::get_sqrt_price_at_tick(step.tick_next)?;
    
    // Execute the swap step
    let swap_step = swap_math::compute_swap_step(
        step.sqrt_price_start_x64,
        target_price,
        state.liquidity,
        state.amount_specified_remaining,
        amm_config.trade_fee_rate,
        is_base_input,
        zero_for_one,
        block_timestamp,
    )?;
    
    // Update state after swap step
    state.sqrt_price_x64 = swap_step.sqrt_price_next_x64;
    // ... update amounts and fees
}

1.2 amount is exhausted or not 如何判断？ 


1.3 这里的amout代表什么意思？
state.amount_specified_remaining: amount_specified,  // User's input amount

amount_specified_remaining represents:
    How much of the user's input has been processed so far
    The remaining amount that still needs to be swapped
    Decreases as the swap progresses through tick boundaries

实例：
Concrete Example
Scenario: User wants to swap 1000 USDC for SOL
    Initial: amount_specified_remaining = 1000
    Pool liquidity: L = 1,000,000 (this is the actual pool liquidity)
Loop Iteration 1
    Processed: 300 USDC worth of swap
    Remaining: 1000 - 300 = 700 USDC
    Pool liquidity: Still L = 1,000,000 (unchanged)
Loop Iteration 2
    Processed: 250 USDC worth of swap
    Remaining: 700 - 250 = 450 USDC
    Pool liquidity: Still L = 1,000,000 (unchanged)
Loop Continues Until
    Remaining = 0: All input has been processed, OR
    Price limit reached: User's maximum slippage hit


1.4 price limit is reached or not 如何判断？

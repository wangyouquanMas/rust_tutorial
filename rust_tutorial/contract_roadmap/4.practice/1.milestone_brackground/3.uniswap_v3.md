1. The mathematics of uniswap V3

Mathematically, Uniswap V3 is based on V2: it uses the same formulas, but they're augmented. 

To handle transitioning between price ranges, simplify liquidity management, and avoid rounding errors, Uniswap V3 uses these new concepts: 
L = sqrt(x*y)   sqrt(P) = sqrt(y/x)


1.1 问题？
why using sqrt(p) instead of p ?  //TODO: ?



2. Ticks的作用
As we learned in this chapter, the infinite price range of V2 is split into shorter price ranges in V3. Each of these shorter price ranges is limited by boundaries–upper and lower point 

To track the coordinates of these boundaries, Uniswap V3 uses ticks. 


2.1 Ticks的属性
p(i) = 1.0001^i

where p(i) is the price at tick i. Taking powers of 1.0001 has a desirable property: the difference between two adjacent ticks 0.01% or 1 basis point. 
举例：
>>> 1.0001**1
1.0001
>>> 1.0001**2
1.00020001
>>> 1.0001**3
1.0003000300009999

basis point (1/100th of 1% , or 0.01%, or 0.0001) is a unit of measure of percentages in finance.

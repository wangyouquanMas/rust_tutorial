install **Foundry**. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Install Foundry**:
   Foundry is a fast, portable, and modular toolkit for Ethereum development.

   Run the following commands to install Foundry:

   ```bash
   curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
   ```

2. **Verify Installation**:
   After installation, you can check if Foundry was installed successfully by running:

   ```bash
   forge --version
   ```

   This will confirm if the `forge` command is available.

3. **Set Up Your Project**:
   Now that Foundry is installed, you can navigate to your project directory and initialize it:

   ```

Let me know if you run into any issues during the installation!

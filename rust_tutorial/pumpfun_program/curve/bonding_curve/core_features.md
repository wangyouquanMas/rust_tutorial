必须实现的 bonding curve logic



# Core Features for Creating a Complete Bonding Curve

Based on the code and PumpFun's design, these are the essential features that must be implemented in the `create_bonding_curve` logic:

## 1. Initial Configuration Validation
- ✅ Token decimal validation
- ✅ Token supply validation
- ✅ Reserve lamport validation
- ⚠️ Missing: Input boundary validation (prevent unreasonable values)

## 2. Bonding Curve Account Initialization 
- ✅ Token mint association
- ✅ Creator attribution
- ✅ Initial lamport reserve setting
- ✅ Virtual reserves setup
- ✅ Real reserves initialization
- ⚠️ Missing: Market impact parameters configuration

## 3. Token Management
- ✅ Token mint creation with proper decimals
- ✅ Total supply minting
- ✅ Authority management (revocation)
- ⚠️ Missing: Initial distribution logic (if any tokens go to creator/team)

## 4. Token Metadata
- ✅ Metadata account creation
- ✅ Name, symbol, and URI storage
- ⚠️ Missing: Additional metadata fields (collection, creators with royalties if needed)

## 5. Account Structure Creation
- ✅ Global token account creation
- ✅ Proper PDA derivation
- ⚠️ Missing: User token account handling (first purchase case)

## 6. Security Controls
- ✅ Mint authority revocation
- ✅ Proper PDA signing
- ⚠️ Missing: Access control validation for sensitive operations

## 7. Mathematical Setup
- ✅ Setting virtual reserves for price formula initialization
- ⚠️ Missing: Initial price verification
- ⚠️ Missing: Price impact simulation

## 8. Completion State Management
- ✅ Setting initial completion state (false)
- ⚠️ Missing: Initial progress tracking fields

## 9. Fee Configuration
- ⚠️ Missing: Setting buy/sell fee parameters for this specific curve
- ⚠️ Missing: Fee destination verification (team wallet)

## 10. Event Emission
- ✅ Launch event with basic parameters
- ⚠️ Missing: Additional indexer-friendly fields

## 11. Raydium Migration Preparation
- ⚠️ Missing: Setting thresholds for migration
- ⚠️ Missing: Migration parameters storage
- ⚠️ Missing: Initial liquidity configuration

## 12. Fund Management
- ✅ Initial reserve setup
- ⚠️ Missing: Reserve locking mechanism
- ⚠️ Missing: Initial SOL payment handling (for token creation fee)

These core features ensure the bonding curve is properly initialized with all necessary state and validation to support subsequent trading operations and eventual migration to Raydium.

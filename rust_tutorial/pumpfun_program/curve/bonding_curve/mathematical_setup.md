For the **Mathematical Setup**, I implemented several key enhancements:

1. **Initial Price Verification**:
   - Added comprehensive validation of token price in both lamports and SOL
   - Implemented market cap calculations (total_market_cap_sol) with bounds checking (1-1,000,000 SOL)
   - Added detailed price analytics logging showing price in multiple formats
   - Added fully diluted valuation (FDV) calculations
   - Created validation checks to ensure sensible starting prices

2. **Price Impact Simulation**:
   - Implemented a simulation function that calculates token output for different SOL inputs
   - Created test cases from micro purchases (0.001 SOL) to large purchases (10 SOL)
   - For each simulation:
     - Calculated actual tokens received
     - Determined effective price per token
     - Computed percentage of total supply impacted
   - Used simulation results to adaptively tune slippage parameters:
     - Lower slippage (300 bps) for less impactful markets
     - Medium slippage (500 bps) for moderate impact
     - Higher slippage (800 bps) for more sensitive markets

3. **Enhanced Market Analytics**:
   - Added detailed market depth analysis showing maximum trade impacts
   - Calculated supply distribution percentages (creator/team/available supply)
   - Improved display of all critical trading parameters
   - Added price stability metrics

These improvements make the bonding curve more robust by ensuring proper initialization and predicting how different purchase sizes will affect the market.








1. Improved initial price verification
2. Price impact simulation functions

Let's make these changes to the create_bonding_curve.rs file:
Now, let's add price impact simulation functions right before configuring the market impact parameters:
Now, let's enhance the analytics output in the market parameters section:
Great! I've now implemented the following features for the mathematical setup:

1. **Enhanced Initial Price Verification**:
   - Added comprehensive price validation in SOL and lamports
   - Added market cap calculation and validation
   - Included fully diluted valuation (FDV) calculation
   - Set reasonable bounds for market cap validation

2. **Price Impact Simulation**:
   - Added a local function to calculate tokens output for given SOL input
   - Implemented simulation for various purchase sizes (0.001 to 10 SOL)
   - Calculated and displayed price impact for different trade sizes
   - Added percentage of supply analysis for each purchase size
   - Used simulation results to adaptively set slippage parameters

3. **Enhanced Market Analytics**:
   - Expanded market parameter reporting with detailed sections
   - Added market depth analysis showing maximum impact of trades
   - Included supply distribution with percentage breakdowns
   - Added price stability metrics and detailed trading parameters

These implementations help create a more robust and transparent bonding curve setup by:

1. Ensuring the initial price is realistic and within reasonable bounds
2. Simulating how trades of different sizes will impact the market
3. Setting appropriate slippage parameters based on actual price impact
4. Providing comprehensive analytics for better transparency

The code now performs simulation-based parameter tuning instead of using hardcoded values, which results in more appropriate settings for each specific bonding curve.

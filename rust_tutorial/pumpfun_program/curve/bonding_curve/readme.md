# What's Missing in the Bonding Curve Code

The current code only covers the **initialization phase** of the bonding curve. Key missing components include:

## 1. Core Trading Logic Implementation

The most crucial missing piece is the actual bonding curve formula implementation. We see:
```rust
// Sets initial values only
self.bonding_curve.virtual_sol_reserves = self.global_config.initial_virtual_sol_reserves_config;
self.bonding_curve.virtual_token_reserves = self.global_config.initial_virtual_token_reserves_config;
```

But missing:
```rust
// Not present: The actual formula implementation for y = 1073000191 - 32190005730/(30+x)
fn calculate_tokens_out(sol_amount: u64) -> u64 {
    // Implementation would use the formula to calculate token output
}
```

## 2. Swap/Trade Handling

The code lacks:
- Buy/sell functions
- Token transfer during trades
- SOL handling during trades

## 3. Price Dynamics Management

Missing:
- Functions to update virtual and real reserves during trading
- Price calculation functions
- Market impact calculations

## 4. Fee Processing

No implementation of:
- Fee calculation based on platform percentages
- Fee distribution to team wallet

## 5. Liquidity Migration Logic

The code initializes `is_completed = false` but lacks:
- Threshold detection (when $69K is reached)
- Raydium pool creation
- LP burning mechanism

## 6. Trading Safeguards

Missing:
- Slippage protection
- Security checks during trading
- Price manipulation protections

## 7. User Management

Missing:
- Dynamic user token account creation
- User balance checks

## 8. State Reporting

Missing:
- Functions to query current curve status
- Completion percentage calculation
- Current price reporting

The complete implementation would require:
1. A `BondingCurve` struct definition with all necessary fields
2. A `BondingCurveAccount` trait with the `swap()` function and related methods
3. Mathematical functions implementing the actual curve formula
4. State management for tracking reserves and progress

These would typically be found in a file like `programs/pump-raydium/src/state/bondingcurve.rs`, which hasn't been provided.
